\section{Introduction}
Sorting is one of the most fundamental operations
in computer science useful in numerous applica-
tions. Given a sequence of numbers as input, the
output should provide a non-decreasing sequence
of numbers as output. More formally, we define a
sorting problem as follows [1],\newline
\textbf{Input}: A sequence of n numbers $\langle a_1 , a_2 , ..., a_n \rangle$.
\textbf{Output}: \hspace{10pt} A reordered sequence (of \hspace{5pt} size\hspace{5pt}  n)
$\langle a_1^{'} , a_2^{'} , ..., a_n^{'}\rangle$  of the input sequence such that $a_1 \leq
a_2 \leq ... \leq a_n$ .\newline
Consider the following example. Given an input
sequence $\langle8, 34, 7, 9, 15, 91, 15\rangle$, a sorting algorithm
should return $\langle7, 8, 9, 15, 15, 34, 91\rangle$ as output. \par
A fundamental problem like sorting has attracted
many researchers who contributed with innovative
algorithms to solve the problem of sorting \textit{effi-
ciently} [3]. Efficiency of an algorithm depends on
primarily on two aspects,\vspace{5pt} \noindent

In the branch of algorithms and complexity in com-
puter science, space complexity takes a back seat
compared to time complexity. Recently, another
parameter of computing i.e., energy consumption
has become popular. Roy et al.[4] proposed an energy complexity model for algorithms. In this document, we will deal with time complexity of sorting
algorithms.\par One class of algorithms which are based on \textit{ele-
ment comparison} are commonly known as \textit{compar-
ison based sorting algorithms}. In this document we will provide a brief overview of \texttt{Quicksort}, a commonly
used comparison based sorting algorithm [2]. Quicksort
is a sorting algorithm based on \textit{divide-and-conquer}
paradigm of algorithm design.Further,
we
will
derive the lower bound of any comparison
based
sorting algorithm to be $\Omega(n \log_2 n)$ for
an
input
size
of n.} \noindent
\section{Quicksort} 
Quicksort is designed as a three-step divide-and-
conquer process for sorting an input sequence in
an array [1]. For any given subarray, \textit{A}[\textit{i..j}], the
process is as follows, \newline
\textbf{Divide}: The array \textit{A}[\textit{i..j}] is partitioned into two
subarrays \textit{A}[\textit{i..k}] and \textit{A}[\textit{k} + 1..\textit{j}] such that all ele-
ments in \textit{A}[\textit{i..k}] is less than or equal to all elements
in \textit{A}[\textit{k} + 1..\textit{j}]. A partitioning procedure is called to
determine \textit{k} such that at the end of partitioning,the element at the $\textit{$k^{th}$}$ position (i.e., \textit{A}[\textit{k}]) does not change its position in the final output array.

  \label{algo:ins_sort1}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
     \Procedure{Partition}{\textit{A,i,j}}\newline
     \Comment{\textit{A} is an array of \textit{N} integers, \textit{A}[1..\textit{N}]} \newline
     \Comment{\textit{i} and \textit{j} are the start and end of subarray}
      \State $x \leftarrow A[i]$
      \State $y \leftarrow i - 1$
      \State $z \leftarrow j + 1$
      \While {(true)}
          \State $z \leftarrow z - 1$ 
          \While {$A[z]>x$}
          \State $z \leftarrow z - 1$ 
          \EndWhile
          \State $y \leftarrow y + 1$ 
          \While {$A[y] < x$}
          \State $y \leftarrow y + 1$ 
          \EndWhile 
          \If {$y < z$}
            \State Swap $A[y]\leftrightarrow A[z]$
           \Else
          \State  return \textit{z} 
          \EndIf
          
               \EndWhile
      \EndProcedure 
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm} \newline

\noindent \textbf{Conquer:}Recursively invoke \texttt{Quicksort} on the two subarrays. This procedure conquers the complexity by applying the same operations in two subarrays. \vspace{5pt}

\noindent \textbf{Merge:} Quicksort does not require merge or combine operation as the entire array \textit{$A[i..j]$} is sorted in place.

 In the heart of \texttt{Quicksort}, there is a partition
procedure as shown in Algorithm 1. A pivot element
$x$ is selected. The first inner while loop (line
\#6) continues examining elements until it finds an
element that is smaller than or equal to the pivot element.
Similarly, the second inner while loop (line
\#9) continues examining elements until it finds an
element that is greater than or equal to the pivot
element. If indices $y$ and $z$ have not exchanged
their side around the pivot, the elements at $A[y]$
and $A[z]$ are exchanged. Otherwise, the procedure
returns the index $z$, such that all elements to the
left of $z$ are smaller than or equal to $A[z]$ and all
elements to the right of $z$ are greater than or equal
to $A[z]$.\newline
\hspace*{5pt} The main recursive procedure for \texttt{Quicksort} is
\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{\texttt{Quicksort} recursion}

  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
     \Procedure{Quicksort}{\textit{$A,i,j$}}\newline
     \Comment{Quicksort procedure called with \textit{$A, 1, N$} }
     
      \If {$ i < j$} 
            \State   $k\leftarrow$ $\textsc{Partition}(A,i,j)$ 
            \State  $\textsc{Quicksort}(A, i, k)$ 
            \State  $\textsc{Quicksort}(A, k + 1, j)$ 
      \EndIf
      \EndProcedure 
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm} \newline

\noindent presented in Algorithm 2. Initial invocation is performed
by call QUICKSORT$(A, 1, N)$ where \textit{N} is
the length of array N.

\subsection{Time complexity analysis of \texttt{Quicksort}}
The worst case of \texttt{Quicksort} occurs when an array of length \textit{N}, gets partitioned into two subarrays of size N-1 and 1 in every recursive invocation of QUICKSORT procedure in Algorithm 2. The partitioning procedure presented in Algorithm 1, takes $\Theta(n)$ time, the recurrence relation for running time
is,\begin{center}
    $ T(n) = T(n-1) + \Theta(n)$
\end{center}
As it is evident that $T(1)$ = $\Theta(1)$, the recurrence is solved as follows,
\begin{align*}
     T(n) &= T(n-1) + \Theta(n)\\
          &= \sum_{k=1}^{n} \Theta (k) \\
          &= \Theta\Bigg(\sum_{k=1}^{n}k\Bigg) \\
          &= \Theta(n^2) \qedher
\end{align*}

Therefore,if the partitioning is always maximally
unbalanced, the running time is $\Theta(n^2)$. Intutively, if an input sequence is almost sorted, \texttt{Quicksort} will perform poorly. In the best case, partitioning divides the array into two equal parts. Thus, the
recurrence for the best case is given by,
\begin{equation*}
    T(n) = 2T\bigg(\frac{n}{2}\bigg)+ \Theta(n)
\end{equation*}
\newline
which evaluates to $\Theta(n \log_2 n)$. Using a comparatively
involved analysis, the average running time
of \texttt{Quicksort} can be determined to be $O(n \lg n)$.

\section{Lower bounds on comparison
sorts}
An interesting question about sorting algorithms
based on comparisons is the following: What is
the lower bound of this class of sorting algorithms?
This question is important for algorithm
researchers to further improve the sorting algorithms.\par
A decision tree based analysis leads to the following
theorem [1].\newline
\newline
\textbf{Theorem 1}. \textit{Any decision tree that sorts n elements
has height $\Omega(n \log_{2}(n)$}.\newline
\newline
\textit{Proof}. Consider a decision tree of height \textit{h} that
sorts \textit{n} elements. Since there are $n!$ permutations
of \textit{n} elements, each permutation representing a distinct
sorted order, the tree must have at least $n!$
leaves. Since a binary tree of height \textit{h} has no more
than $2^{h}$
leaves. So,\newline

$n! \leq 2^h$\newline

\noindent Applying logarithmic $(\log_2
)$, the inequality becomes,\newline

\noindent$h \geq \lg(n!).$\newline

\noindent Applying Stirling$^'$s approximations,
\begin{equation*}
\leftskip n! > \bigg(\frac{n}{e}\bigg)^n,\\
 \end{equation*}

where e is natural base of logarithms. Further,
\begin{eqnarray*}
   h &\geq& \lg \left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n \\
    &=&  n\lg{n} - n\lg {e}\\
    &=& \Omega(n \lg {n})
  \end{eqnarray*} \noindent
